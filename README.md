# Office Network Simulation

Welcome to the **Office Network Simulation** project! This project demonstrates a network design for a mid-sized office using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network ensures efficient connectivity, segmentation, and security for different departments, with essential services such as DHCP, DNS, VLANs, and inter-VLAN routing.

---

## üìù Project Overview

This simulation features:
- Segmented departments with VLANs:
  - **Admin**: `192.168.10.0/24`
  - **HR**: `192.168.20.0/24`
  - **IT**: `192.168.30.0/24`
  - **Finance**: `192.168.40.0/24`
- Centralized inter-VLAN routing using a router.
- DHCP and DNS servers for automated IP management and name resolution.
- Internet access for all devices through NAT.
- Secure wireless connectivity with WPA2 encryption.
- Basic security measures using Access Control Lists (ACLs).

## üåê Network Topology

### Diagram Highlights:
1. **Router**: Connects the office network to the internet and facilitates inter-VLAN routing.
2. **Switches**: Core and access switches for wired connectivity.
3. **Wireless Access Point**: Provides secure wireless access for mobile devices.
4. **Servers**: DHCP and DNS servers to support the network's functionality.
5. **End Devices**: PCs, laptops, and printers assigned to specific departments.

## üìã Device Configurations

Below are the configurations for each major device in the network.  

### **1. Router (Cisco 2911)**
#### VLAN Sub-Interfaces for Inter-VLAN Routing:
```bash
enable
configure terminal
interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.10
encapsulation dot1Q 10
ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.20
encapsulation dot1Q 20
ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.30
encapsulation dot1Q 30
ip address 192.168.30.1 255.255.255.0
exit

interface gigabitEthernet 0/0.40
encapsulation dot1Q 40

exit


NAT for Internet Access:
ip nat inside source list 1 interface gigabitEthernet 0/1 overload
access-list 1 permit 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255

interface gigabitEthernet 0/0
ip nat inside

interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
ip nat outside

Assigning VLANs to Ports:
interface range fastEthernet 0/1-10
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 10

interface range fastEthernet 0/11-20
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 20

interface range fastEthernet 0/21-30
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 30

interface range fastEthernet 0/31-40
switchport mode access
switchport access vlan 40


Configuring Trunk Ports:
interface gigabitEthernet 0/1
switchport mode trunk
exit
